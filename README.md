# Path Visualizer

This project is an interactive **Path Visualizer** that allows users to visualize various pathfinding algorithms in real-time. It integrates algorithms such as **Dijkstra**, **DFS**, **BFS**, and **Bellman-Ford** to find the shortest path and display the traversal process dynamically.

## Live Demo

You can access the live demo of the project at the following link:

## Features

- **Interactive Path Visualization**: Real-time computation and display of shortest path algorithms such as Dijkstra, DFS, BFS, and Bellman-Ford.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Placement**: Users can place and remove obstacles to visualize how the algorithms adapt to different grid configurations.
- **Responsive Design**: The tool adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Path Recalculation**: Pathfinding is recalculated in real-time whenever the grid is modified, ensuring immediate feedback.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vite, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Algorithms**: Dijkstra, DFS, BFS, Bellman-Ford
